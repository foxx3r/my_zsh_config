# my_zsh_config
It's a repository for storing my oh-my-zsh configuration

# Features

**1. Command not found**

When a command wasn't found, ZSH will try to use command-not-found of Ubuntu or openSUSE, as you can see below:

```
$ mutt
The program 'mutt' can be found in the following packages:
 * mutt
 * mutt-kz
 * mutt-patched
Try: sudo apt install <selected package>
```

**2. Double tap and types sudo**

Whether you enter ESC twice, it will write "sudo"

**3. A safe environment using dotenv**

**4. Native support for gitignore**

See the command `gi` for more information.

**5. Native support for yarn, rustc, cargo and npm**

**6. Native support for emojis**

**7. It uses zsh-completions**

The zsh-completions allows us to access several functions that haven't added yet on ZSH.

**8. ZSH + Fish**

If you like the completion system of fish, but you like the power of ZSH, so you will feel very comfortable with that ZSH, because it has a completion system too.

**9. The bestest support for Debian**

If you are using Debian, that ZSH will be very important for you, because it has several functions about the sysadmin on Debian

**10. Interesting aliases**

- myip = see your ip
- untar = extracts tar
- ungz = extracts tar.gz
- untarbz2 = extracts tar.bz2
- ports = see running ports

**11. Functions to make your experience with git, very fast and with no stdess**

- acp = creates the base of git repository, it takes one parameter, that's the name of your repository
- cap = pushes your project to github, it takes one parameter, that's the commit message
